== About me
I am a Master's student in computer science at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Dr. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~bzhan/ Bohua Zhan]. I am in the research group in [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/en/ State Key Lab. of Computer Science] leaded by Prof. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/ Naijun Zhan]. My research focused on theorem proving of hybrid systems. And I am going to work on safe reinforcement learning via formal methods.

== Education 
- M.Eng. in Computer Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Sep. 2020 (- July 2023)
- B.Eng. in Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University (ZJU), Sep. 2016 - July 2020

== Experiences
=== Research Experiences
- *HHLPy: Practical Verification of Hybrid Systems Using Hoare Logic* \n
Research Assistant, Master's Thesis Research
-- Designed and proved rules for ordinary differential equation commands in Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes.
-- Devised verification condition generation algorithm with Python implementation.
-- Designed labelling and highlighting mechanisms to distinguish and visualize verification conditions for proof reuse and debugging purposes.
-- Developed a user-friendly interface for the tool, implemented in JavaScript.\n
HHLPy is also part of the Mars toolchain and has already been used successfully in other projects..

- *Requirements Classification and Formalization of Trustworthy Systems* \n
Group Member, Industrial Collaboration with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
-- Searched and summarized recent works on formal specification and verification tools on security and privacy. 
-- Presented trustworthiness-related papers in weekly seminar with Huawei.

=== Course Projects
- *Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning*:
    Completed projects such as sentiment analysis of movie comments, automatic poem writing, cats vs dogs classification, cart pole control, gridworld,  etc.
- *Foundation of Network Attack and Defense*:
    Implemented a Network Sniffer, 
    Ran a Buffer Overflow Attack on War-ftp 1.65.
- *Concurrent Data Structures and Multicore Programming*:
    Built a Train Ticketing System.
