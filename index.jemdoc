== About me
I am a Master's student in computer science at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Dr. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~bzhan/ Bohua Zhan]. I am in the [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/en/ State Key Lab. of Computer Science] leaded by Prof. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/ Naijun Zhan]. My research focused on theorem proving of hybrid systems last academic year. And I am going to work on safe reinforcement learning via formal methods this semester.

== Education 
- M.Eng. in Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS), Sep. 2020 (- July 2023)
- B.Eng. in Materials Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University(ZJU), Sep. 2016 - July 2020
- Summer Session Program, King's College London, July 2019 - Aug. 2019

== Experiences
=== Research Experiences
- HHLPy: Practical Verification of Hybrid Systems Using Hoare Logic \n
Research Assistant, Thesis Research
-- Extent Hoare Logic to hybrid systems expressed in HCSP (Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes).
-- Designed and implemented the verification condition generation algorithm.
-- Designed a labelling system and code highlighting mechanism to distinguish and visualize verification conditions.
-- Implemented the tool with Python and JavaScript. The tool has a friendly user interface.\n
The tool participated in Hybrid Systems Theorem Proving category in the ARCH-COMP Friendly Competition 2022.

- Requirements Classification and Formalization of Trustworthy Systems \n
Group Member, Industrial Collaboration with Huawei
-- Specified product requirements of trustworthy systems in formal language. 
-- Searched and summarized verification methods and tools for the requirements.

=== Courses
- Formal Methods:
         Read Principles of Model Checking and Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems.
- Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning:
        Completed projects such as sentiment analysis of movie comments, automatic poem writing,
        cats vs dogs classification, cart pole, etc.
