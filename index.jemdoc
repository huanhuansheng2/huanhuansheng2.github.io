== About me
I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Dr. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~bzhan/ Bohua Zhan]. I am in the [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/en/ State Key Lab. of Computer Science], researching on formal methods, leaded by Prof. [https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/ Naijun Zhan]. My research focuses on theorem proving on hybrid systems. And I'm going to focus on safe reinforcement learning in the new semester.

== Experiences
=== Research Experiences
- HHLPy: Practical Verification of Hybrid Systems using Hoare Logic
~~~
Research Assistant, Thesis Research
~~~
-- Built the proof system based on Hoare Logic. Extend Hoare Logic to handle hybrid systems.
-- Designed labelling and highlighting mechanisms to distinguish and visualize verification conditions.
-- Implemented the tool with Python and JavaScript. The tool has a friendly user interface.
The tool participated in Hybrid Systems Theorem Proving category in the ARCH-COMP Friendly Competition 2022.
The paper is in preparation.
